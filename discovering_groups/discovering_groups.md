# Discovering Groups

We will expand on the previous ideas of making recommendations and learn data clustering, a method for discovering and visualizing groups of things, people, or ideas that are all closely related.

## Goals:
1. How to prepare data from a variety of sources.
2. Two different clustering algorithms
3. More on distance metrics.
4. Simple graphical visualization code for viewing the generated groups.
5. A method for projecting very complicated datasets into two dimensions.
